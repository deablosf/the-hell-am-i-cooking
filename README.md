### Wireframe
I dont have one drawn. It'll have a search bar and output 10 choices with images. From there if you click the image it'll take you to the recipe.

### Expected roadblocks
Every, like always.

### Timeframe/Schedule

#####Today - get the search working and give ten result names and images per search. And try to finish the weather app.

#####Tomorrow - when. You click on the result it will take you to the recipe.

#####And The next day - figure out what the damned thing will look like.

#####And the next - finish the site.

#####And another day - see if I can search for just the ingredients listed and nothing else.
